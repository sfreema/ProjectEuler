    "1. The top right number in any $n$ by $n$ square matrix of this kind is $n^2$. This is always an odd square.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, the $n-1$ by $n-1$ square matrix that covers the bottom right of the $n$ by $n$ square matrix achieves its highest number in the bottom left, which is always an even square (see the 4 and 16 in the above example). As a result, the bottom left number in the $n$ by $n$ matrix is an even square plus 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The top left and bottom right diagonal numbers for a given $n$ by $n$ square matrix can be calculated from $(n-1)^2 + 1 \\pm n-1$. Summing these numbers however will cancel the $\\pm n-1$ terms, so overall for a given $n$ by $n$ square matrix ($n > 1$) its sum contribution is $n^2 + 3[(n-1)^2 + 1]$. Let's check this:\n",
    " - $n=3$: Sum is 24. $(3)^2 + 3[(3-1)^2 + 1] = 24$\n",
    " - $n=5$: The formula gives 76\n",
    " - Adding the contribution from $n=1,2,3$, we get a sum of 101 as expected."
